A string S consisting of N characters is considered to be properly nested if any of the following conditions is true:
S is empty;
S has the form "(U)" or "[U]" or "{U}" where U is a properly nested string;
S has the form "VW" where V and W are properly nested strings.
For example, the string "{[()()]}" is properly nested but "([)()]" is not.
Write a function:
class Solution { public int solution(String S); }
that, given a string S consisting of N characters, returns 1 if S is properly nested and 0 otherwise.
For example, given S = "{[()()]}", the function should return 1 and given S = "([)()]", the function should return 0, as explained above.
Assume that:
N is an integer within the range [0..200,000];
string S consists only of the following characters: "(", "{", "[", "]", "}" and/or ")".
Complexity:
expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);
expected worst-case space complexity is O(N) (not counting the storage required for input arguments).
